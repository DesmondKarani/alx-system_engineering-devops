# Linux Process Management and Signal Handling: 0x05. Processes and signals

## Overview
This project focuses on understanding and managing processes in Linux. It covers key concepts like Process IDs (PIDs), process management, and signal handling. Through a series of Bash scripts, we will explore how to interact with and control Linux processes.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, I should be able to:
- Explain what a PID is and its significance in Linux.
- Understand the lifecycle and management of a process in Linux.
- Find a process's PID and use it in process management.
- Kill a process using various methods and commands.
- Explain what a signal is in the context of Linux processes.
- Identify and describe the two signals that cannot be ignored in Linux.

## Requirements
- **Editor:** vi, vim, emacs.
- **Environment:** Scripts will be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
- **Documentation:** All scripts should end with a new line. A `README.md` file is mandatory.
- **Script Standards:** 
  - All Bash script files must be executable.
  - Scripts must pass Shellcheck (version 0.7.0) without any error.
  - The first line of all Bash scripts should be `#!/usr/bin/env bash`.
  - The second line of all Bash scripts should be a comment explaining the script's purpose.

## Ethics and Plagiarism
- Originality is crucial. Plagiarism is strictly forbidden and can result in removal from the program.
- Do not publish any content from this project.
