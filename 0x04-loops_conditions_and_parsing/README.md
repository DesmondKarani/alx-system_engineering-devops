# Bash Scripting Project: 0x04. Loops, conditions and parsing

## Overview

This project focuses on enhancing Bash scripting skills, particularly in the context of Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. It is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of various aspects of Bash scripting, including loop constructs, conditional statements, file operations, and script portability.

## Learning Objectives

- **SSH Keys**: Understand the creation and usage of SSH keys.
- **Script Portability**: Learn the benefits of `#!/usr/bin/env bash` over `#!/bin/bash`.
- **Loops**: Gain proficiency in `while`, `until`, and `for` loops.
- **Conditional Statements**: Master `if`, `else`, `elif`, and `case`.
