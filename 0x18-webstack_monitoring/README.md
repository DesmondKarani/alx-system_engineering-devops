# 0x18. Webstack Monitoring

## Description

This project, "0x18. Webstack Monitoring," is designed for individuals involved in DevOps and SysAdmin roles, focusing on the essential aspect of monitoring webstacks. Monitoring is a critical component in managing and maintaining the health of software systems and the servers they run on. This project aims to implement and understand the tools necessary for effective web stack monitoring, covering both application and server monitoring aspects.

Monitoring enables the identification and resolution of issues before they escalate, ensuring the systems perform optimally. This project emphasizes the importance of measuring system performance to make informed decisions for improvements.

## Background Context

In the tech industry, a famous saying goes, "You cannot fix or improve what you cannot measure." The era of data-ism underscores the significance of monitoring our Software systems. This project focuses on deploying tools to measure and monitor the performance of servers, highlighting two main categories:

- **Application Monitoring:** Involves collecting data about running software to ensure it behaves as expected.
- **Server Monitoring:** Entails gathering data about virtual or physical servers to prevent overloads related to CPU, memory, disk, or network.

## Resources

- What is server monitoring
- What is application monitoring
- System monitoring by Google
- Nginx logging and monitoring

## Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this project, learners should be able to:

- Explain the necessity of monitoring.
- Differentiate between the two main areas of monitoring: Application and Server.
- Understand the purpose of access logs and error logs for web servers like Nginx.

## Requirements

### General

- Editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
- Every file should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the project folder, is mandatory
- Bash script files must be executable
- Bash scripts must pass Shellcheck (version 0.3.7) without any error
- The first line of all Bash scripts should be `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
- The second line of all Bash scripts should be a comment explaining the script's purpose
