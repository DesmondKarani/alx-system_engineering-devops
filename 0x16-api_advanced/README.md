# 0x16. API advanced

## Description

This project is centered around leveraging the Reddit API for advanced scripting and back-end tasks. It's designed to sharpen your skills in working with APIs, from understanding their documentation to handling pagination, parsing JSON, and making recursive API calls. These abilities are crucial not only for acing technical interviews but also for practical applications that can simplify various aspects of your daily life.

### Background Context

In many technical interviews, candidates are often asked to interact with APIs. The tasks might range from simple API calls to more complex requirements like using recursive functions to process data. The Reddit API serves as an excellent platform for this practice, offering a wealth of endpoints that don't require authentication and provide vast amounts of data to work with.

### Resources

- [Reddit API Documentation](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/)
- [Query String](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string)

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand how to navigate API documentation to find required endpoints.
- Utilize APIs that involve pagination.
- Parse JSON results from API responses.
- Make recursive API calls.
- Sort dictionaries by their values.

### Copyright - Plagiarism

- You must not publish any content from this project.
- Plagiarism is strictly prohibited and will lead to expulsion from the program.

### Requirements

#### General

- **Editors**: vi, vim, emacs
- **Environment**: All files will be run on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3).
- **Coding Style**: Adhere to PEP 8 style guidelines.
- **Documentation**: Each module must be documented.
- **Dependencies**: Use the Requests module for HTTP requests to the Reddit API.

#### Specifics

- All your files should end with a new line.
- The first line of all your Python files must be `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- Libraries must be imported in alphabetical order.
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the project folder, is mandatory.
- All files must be executable.
- File lengths will be tested using `wc`.

### Project Timeline

- **Start**: Apr 9, 2024, 6:00 AM
- **Checker Release**: Apr 9, 2024, 12:00 PM
- **Deadline**: Apr 10, 2024, 6:00 AM
- **Auto Review**: An automatic review will be launched at the deadline.

### Challenges

1. **Explore the Reddit API**: Use the documentation to find interesting endpoints.
2. **Pagination Handling**: Implement functions to navigate through paginated data.
3. **Data Parsing**: Write scripts to parse and present JSON data from API responses.
4. **Recursive Calls & Sorting**: Develop solutions that require recursive API calls and sorting of data structures.

This project is an opportunity to demonstrate the ability to interact with complex APIs and process data efficiently.
