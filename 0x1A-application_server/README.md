# 0x1A. Application Server

## Project Overview
This project integrates an application server into our existing web infrastructure that currently uses Nginx to serve web pages. Our goal is to enhance our setup by adding an application server that will handle the dynamic content of our Airbnb clone project. This involves configuring and plugging an application server with Nginx on Ubuntu 16.04.

## Timeline
