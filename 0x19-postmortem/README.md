## Background Context

In the tech industry, systems are bound to fail due to various reasons ranging from bugs, traffic spikes, security issues, hardware failures, natural disasters, to human error. It's crucial for Software Engineers to learn from these failures to prevent them from recurring. A postmortem is a structured document used after an outage to detail the event and ensure that measures are taken to prevent future occurrences.
