# Port Forwarding Configuration for UFW
# This configuration redirects traffic from port 8080 to port 80 using NAT.

1. Open the UFW before rules file:
sudo nano /etc/ufw/before.rules

2. Add the following NAT rule before the `*filter` section:

*nat
:PREROUTING ACCEPT [0:0]
-A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 8080 -j REDIRECT --to-port 80
COMMIT

This rule instructs the firewall to redirect all incoming TCP traffic on port 8080 to port 80.

3. Save and exit the editor.

4. Apply the changes by disabling and then re-enabling UFW:
sudo ufw disable
sudo ufw enable

5. Verify the UFW status to ensure it's active:
sudo ufw status
